# Framework7 Snippet

Simple yet effective **Framework7 Snippet** for **Visual Studio Code** ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)). It contains UI code snippets to build application faster with Framework7.

## Idea

Inspired from [Framework7](https://framework7.io/docs/) documentation. I thought it would be great if we have only [Framework7](https://framework7.io/) snippets,so created it.
